ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @qwerkon

I specialize in creating software based on technologies used in creating internet applications. 

In my 14-year career as a PHP programmer, I work on many PHP frameworks, e.g. Laravel, Zend and also created dedicated systems in which no frameworks were used. 
I know relational databases very well (MySQL / MariaDB, PostgreSQL), the basics of MongoDB are not strange to me either.
